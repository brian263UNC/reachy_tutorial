The files here are for controlling the mobile base with a gamepad/joystick/controller:

The known controllers that are supported are the following:
	DualShock 4 - by PlayStation
	DualSense - by PlayStation
	Xbox One Controller - by Xbox
	Xbox Series X|S Controller - by Xbox
	Xbox 360 Controller - by Xbox

Though you may be able to connect other controllers to Reachy's base, this guide will not go over them.
You can take the steps and files from this guide to try and connect other 3rd party controllers but
further documentation will more than likely be required.
